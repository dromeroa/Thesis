\section{Track reconstruction}

Under nominal conditions of the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV a typical instantaneous luminosity around $\designlumi$ is expected, with the proton bunches intersecting at intervals of 25 ns. Therefore, the CMS tracker will be cross by about 1000 charged particles at each bunch crossing, producing an average of more than twenty proton-proton (pp) collisions. These multiple interactions are known as \emph{pileup} \cite{1742-6596-404-1-012045}, to which prior or later bunch crossings can also contribute because of the finite time resolution of the detector.

The first step in processing the data prior to track reconstruction is the efficient detection of \emph{hits},
which represent the positions in the sensors of the tracker where charged particles passed through.
Track reconstruction is the process of using the hits on the pixel (section \ref{pixel}) and strip tracker (section \ref{strip}) to estimate the momentum and the position parameters (the longitudinal $z_{0}$ and transverse $d_{0}$ distances relative to the beam axis) of the charged particles responsible for the hits (tracks). Figure \ref{fig:tracks_par} shows the position parameters of a track.

\end{figure}

%In the quasi-uniform magnetic field of the tracker, charged particles follow helical paths and therefore five parameters are needed to define a trajectory. Three pixel hits (triplet) are used to form a track, from which the transverse momentum, the longitudinal $z_{0}$ and transverse $d_{0}$ impact parameters (IP) are computed.
Reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles is a computationally challenging task. Hence, CMS developed a software, which support pattern recognition and track fitting in the same framework, called \emph{Combinatorial Track Finder} (CTF) \cite{Chatrchyan:2014fea}.
This software is based on an adaptation of the \emph{Combinatorial Kalman filter} method \cite{Billoir:1989mh,Billoir:1990we,Mankel:1997dy}, which in turn is an extension of the \emph{Kalman filter} method \cite{Fruhwirth:1987fm}.  

The collection of reconstructed tracks is produced by multiple passes (iterations) of the CTF track
reconstruction sequence, in a process called \emph{iterative tracking}. 
The idea behind iterative tracking is to search in the initial iterations for the easiest tracks to find (e.g., of relatively large $\pt$, and produced near the interaction region). After each iteration, the hits related with tracks are removed in a search
for more difficult classes of tracks (e.g., low-$\pt$, or greatly displaced tracks).
Each iteration process contains four steps:

%\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Seed generation provides initial track candidates found using only a few (2 or 3) hits. A seed
defines the initial estimate of the trajectory parameters and their uncertainties
\item
Track finding is based on a Kalman filter. It extrapolates the seed trajectories along the
expected flight path of a charged particle, searching for additional hits that can be assigned
to the track candidate.
\item
The track-fitting module is used to provide the best possible estimate of the parameters of
each trajectory by means of a Kalman filter and smoother.
\item
Track selection sets quality flags, and discards tracks that fail certain specified criteria
\end{itemize}

Muons are reconstructed better than any other charged particle in the tracker, as they mainly
interact with the silicon detector through ionization of the medium and, unlike electrons, their
energy loss through bremsstrahlung is negligible. Muons therefore tend to cross the entire volume
of the tracking system, producing detectable hits in several sensitive layers of the detector.
For isolated muons with $1 < \pt < 100$ GeV, the tracking efficiency is $>$99$\%$ over the full $\eta$-range of tracker acceptance,
and does not depend on $\pt$ as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:trackeff}. The fake rate is completely negligible.

\section{Primary Vertex (PV) }

The objective of primary-vertex reconstruction is to determine the location, and the related uncertainty, of all proton-proton (pp) interaction vertices in each event, including vertices originated from the primary event or from additional pp interactions (pileup), using the available reconstructed tracks. The method consists of three steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Selection of the tracks
\item
Clustering of the tracks that appear to originate from the same
interaction vertex
\item
Fitting for the position of each vertex using its associated tracks
\end{itemize}

Tracks are selected if they are produced rapidly in the primary interaction region. The selected tracks are clustered based on information from their z-coordinates and  their point of closest approach to the centre of the beam spot. Track clustering is performed using a deterministic annealing (DA) algorithm \cite{Rose}, finding the global minimum for a problem with many degrees of freedom.
After identifying candidate vertices based on the DA clustering, the candidates with at least two tracks are then fitted using an adaptive vertex fitter \cite{Fruhwirth:1027031} to compute the best estimate of vertex parameters (position, covariance matrix, number of degrees of freedom for the vertex, and weights of the tracks used in the vertex). 

%To identify and reject the beam background events, various methods have been investigated.
%Requiring that the event have a high quality primary vertex very close to the nominal inter-
%action point is a powerful rejection technique. The primary vertex is required to have at least
%four degrees of freedom, to be no more than 2 cm in the radial direction and 15 cm in the beam
%direction away from the nominal interaction point. This method provides a very clean sample
%of real proton-proton collision events. The purity of the sample can be evaluated by investigat-
%ing the distributions in Fig. 13 which shows the number of tracks and number of pixel clusters
%in 7 TeV colliding and non-colliding beams, before and after applying the primary vertex se-
%lection. The distributions of tracks and pixel clusters from colliding beams exhibit long tails
%which are not compatible with expectations from simulation.

%In the adaptive vertex fit, each track in the vertex is assigned a weight between 0 and 1, which reflects the likelihood that it genuinely belongs to the vertex. Tracks that are consistent with the position of the reconstructed vertex have a weight
%close to 1, whereas tracks that lie more than a few standard deviations from the vertex have small
%weights. The number of degrees of freedom in the fit is defined as

%\begin{eqnarray}
%n_{\text{dof}} = -3 +2 \sum_{i=1}^{\# \text{tracks} } w_{i} 
%\end{eqnarray}

%where $w_{i}$ is the weight of the ith track, and the sum runs over all tracks associated with the vertex.
%The value of $n_{\text{dof}}$ is therefore strongly correlated with the number of tracks compatible with arising
%from the interaction region. For this reason, $n_{\text{dof}}$can be also used to select true proton-proton
%interactions
 
The primary-vertex efficiency is estimated to be close to 100$\%$ when more than two tracks are used to reconstruct the vertex. Figure \ref{fig:PVeff} shows the efficiency of the primary-vertex reconstruction as a function of the number of tracks clustered in $z$. The effect of pileup on the efficiency is checked using simulated minimum-bias events, with and without added pileup, and the loss of efficiency is found to be $<$ 0.1$\%$ for the pileup with a mean value of 8 \cite{CMS:2010wta}.

\section{Particle Flow (PF) }

The global event reconstruction (also called particle-flow event reconstruction reside in the reconstruction and identification of each single particle with an optimized combination of all subdetector information. In this process, the identification of the particle type (photon, electron, muon, and hadrons) plays an important role in the determination of the particle direction and energy.
 
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Photons}
(\eg coming from \Pgpz  decays or from electron bremsstrahlung) are identified as ECAL energy clusters not linked to the extrapolation of any charged particle trajectory to the ECAL. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects.

\item \textbf{Electrons} 
(\eg coming from photon conversions in the tracker material or from \cPqb-hadron semileptonic decays) are identified as a primary charged particle track and potentially many ECAL energy clusters corresponding to this track extrapolation to the ECAL and to possible bremsstrahlung photons emitted along the way through the tracker material. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum at the main interaction vertex, the corresponding ECAL cluster energy, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons attached to the track.

\item \textbf{Muons}
 (\eg from \cPqb-hadron semileptonic decays) are identified as a track in the central tracker consistent with either a track or several hits in the muon system, associated with an energy deficit in the calorimeters. The energy of muons is obtained from the corresponding track momentum.
 
\item \textbf{Charged hadrons} 
are identified as charged particle tracks neither identified as electrons, nor as muons. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum and the corresponding ECAL and HCAL energy, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers.

\item \textbf{Neutral hadrons}
are identified as HCAL energy clusters not linked to any charged hadron trajectory, or as ECAL and HCAL energy excesses with respect to the expected charged hadron energy deposit. The energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Jets }\label{aniktlab}

Jets are the experimental signatures of quarks and gluons produced in high-energy processes such as hard scattering of partons in proton-proton collisions. The LHC collides protons containing colored partons: quarks, antiquarks and gluons. Almost immediately after being produced, a quark or gluon fragments and hadronises, leading to a collimated spray of energetic hadrons: a jet (Fig. \ref{jet1figure} ).
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{pp-collision resulting in a collimated spray of particles, a jet. \label{jet1figure}}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{physics_objects_plots/Jet1}
\end{figure}

Jets are obvious structures when one looks at an event display, and by measuring their energy and direction one can get close to the idea of the original parton (Fig. \ref{jet2figure}).
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{CMS event display for a dijet reaction \label{jet2figure}}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{physics_objects_plots/Jet2}
\end{figure}

Jet clustering algorithms provide a set of rules for grouping particles into jets. They usually involve one or more parameters that indicate how close two particles must be for them to belong to the same jet. Additionally they are always associated with a recombination scheme, which indicates what momentum to assign to the combination of two particles. Taken together, a jet algorithm with its parameters and a recombination scheme form a jet definition.
There are many types of jet algorithms in the market, but in run-2 CMS will mainly use the anti-kt algorithm. First we introduces the distances $d_{ij}$ between entities (particles, pseudojets) $i$ and $j$ and $d_{iB}$ between entity $i$ and the beam (B). The (inclusive) clustering proceeds by identifying the smallest of the distances and if it is a $d_{ij}$ recombining entities $i$ and $j$, while if it is $d_{iB}$ calling
$i$ a jet and removing it from the list of entities. The distances are recalculated and the procedure repeated until no entities are left. The definitions:
\begin{eqnarray}
d_{ij} &=& \text{min}\left(k^{2p}_{ti},k^{2p}_{tj} \right) \dfrac{\Delta^{2}_{ij}}{\Delta R^{2}}\\
d_{iB} &=& k^{2p}_{ti}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\Delta^{2}_{ij}= (y_{i}-y_{j})^{2}+(\phi_{i}-\phi_{j})^{2}$ and $k_{ti}$, $y_{i}$, $\phi_{i}$ are respectively the transverse momentum, the rapidity and the azimuth of particle $i$. $\Delta R$ is the geometrical distance $\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2} + \Delta\phi^{2}}$. Note that when $p=-1$ we are on the case of  the anti-kt algorithm, which is implemented in the FastJet package.


\subsection{Particle Flow Jet (PFJet)}

The Particle-Flow (PF) jets are reconstructed by clustering the four-momentum vectors of particle-flow candidates. The particle-flow algorithm combines the information from all
relevant CMS sub-detectors to identify and reconstruct all visible particles in the event, namely muons, electrons, photons, charged hadrons, and neutral hadrons. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum and the corresponding ECAL and HCAL energy, corrected for zero-suppression effects, and calibrated for the non-linear response of the calorimeters. The energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding calibrated ECAL and HCAL energy. The PF jet momentum and spatial resolutions are greatly improved with respect to calorimeter jets, as the use of the tracking detectors and of the high granularity of ECAL allows resolution and measurement of charged hadrons and photons inside a jet, which together constitute $\sim$ 85$\%$ of the jet energy.

\subsubsection{Charged hadron subtraction (CHS)}

Contamination to the jet from pileup degrades the ability to reconstruct the jet observables. Previous pile up corections applied in Run I help to correct the four-vector of the jet but not
the jet structure observables. One new approach is use tracking information which takes advantage of the fact that a large fraction of the pileup vertices are separated in space from the vertex of interest. Therefore, charged particles from pileup vertices can be removed from the jets, in a process called "charged hadron subtraction" (CHS) (Fig. \ref{jetchsfigure}). Charged Hadron Subtraction (CHS) is a technique used to reduce the effect of "in-time pileup" on reconstructed physics objects. In this approach, charged hadrons unambiguously associated
to pileup vertices are removed from the event and the remaining PF candidates are allowed to cluster to form jets.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{physics_objects_plots/chs}
\caption{Charged hadron subtraction. \label{jetchsfigure}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Jet Energy Correction ( JEC)}\label{jec}

Jet energy corrections need to be applied to account for the non-linear and non-uniform response of the CMS calorimeters. They associate, on average, the $\ptrans$ of a reconstructed jet to the $\ptrans$ of the corresponding particle jet. Jet energy measured in the detector is typically different from the corresponding particle jet energy. The latter is obtained in the simulation by clustering, with the same jet algorithm, the
stable particles produced during the hadronization process that follows the hard interaction. The main cause for this energy mismatch is the non-uniform and non-linear response of the CMS calorimeters. Furthermore, electronics noise and additional pp interactions in the same bunch crossing (event pile-up) can lead to extra unwanted energy. The purpose of the jet energy correction is to relate, on average, the energy measured in the detector to the energy of the corresponding particle jet.

CMS uses a factorized multi-level jet correction, shown schematically in Fig. \ref{jet3figure}, in
which the correction must be applied in the following fixed sequence:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\textbf{L1:Offset}: Required correction for pile-up and electronic noise.
\item
\textbf{L2:Relative} ($\eta$): Required correction for variations in jet response with pseudorapidity relative to a control region.
\item
\textbf{L3:Absolute} ($p_{T}$): Required correction to particle level versus jet pT in the control region.
\item
\textbf{EMF}: Optional correction for variations in jet response with electromagnetic energy fraction.
\item
\textbf{Flavor}: Optional correction to particle level for different types of jets (light quark, c, b, gluon).
\item
\textbf{Underlying Event}: Optional correction for underlying event energy due to soft interactions involving spectator partons.
\item
\textbf{Parton}: Optional correction to parton level.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Schematic picture of the factorized multi-level jet correction. \label{jet3figure}}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=13cm]{physics_objects_plots/jetcorr2}
\end{figure}
Factorization facilitates the use of data-driven corrections, breaking the correction into pieces that are naturally measured in collider data. Combined correction brings back the jet to the particle level.

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Jets identifiction}\label{jetid}

CMS has developed jet quality criteria (“Jet ID”) for PF jets which
are found to retain the vast majority of real jets in the simulation while rejecting most fake
jets arising from calorimeter and/or readout electronics noise. These are studied in pure noise
non-collision data samples such as cosmic trigger data or data from triggers on empty bunches
during LHC operation.

The PF jets are required to have charged hadron fraction CHF $>$ 0.0 if within tracking fiducial region of $\left| \eta \right| <$ 2.4, neutral hadron fraction NHF $<$ 1.0, charged electromagnetic (electron) fraction CEF $<$ 1.0, and neutral electromagnetic (photon) fraction NEF $<$ 1.0. These requirements remove fake jets arising from
spurious energy depositions in a single sub-detector. Jets in the presented studies are required
to pass Jet ID criteria.

The PFJetID efficiency was estimated using the tag-and-probe technique in real and simulated
dijet events. According to this technique one of the two jets, chosen randomly, is the probe jet
and it has to satisfy always the PFJetID criteria. The other one is the probe jet. The efficiency
is then the ratio of all probe jets passing the PFJetID criteria over all the probe jets. In the $\left| \eta \right|$  region 0-2.5 and 3-5 the efficiency of tight PFJetID for both
data and MC is close to 100$\%$, meaning that the PFJetID did not remove real physics jets, since
the selected sample is clean of noise. For the $\left| \eta \right| $ bin 2.5-3.0, the efficiency drops to $\sim$ 91 and $\sim$ 96 for real and simulated jets respectively.

\end{comment}


\subsection{V-tagging}

Generally, V tagging methods (V=Z,W weak vector boson) have depended largely on leptonic decay channels. Hadronic signatures deal with the relatively poorer reconstruction of jets and large multijet backgrounds from QCD processes at hadron colliders. Several recent developments have improved the tagging of hadronically decaying weak vector bosons. Many of these advances have resulted from the analysis of the internal components
of a jet, i.e. its substructure.

A more effective identification of hadronic V decays allows many analyses to profit from the substantially larger branching fraction of hadronic channels. This, in turn, may provide significant gains in searches for new physics.

\subsubsection{Unresolved jets}

For highly boosted weak vector bosons, the hadronic decay products can be merged into a single jet. For distance parameter R = 0.8, this occurs for boson pT above 200 GeV. The radiation profile of the individual, hard partons within a merged jet must be explicitly resolved for an accurate calculation of the boson mass. This contrasts with the resolved scenario, for which the boson mass can be determined simply from the properties of the individually reconstructed jets. A new class of observables has been developed for disentangling the radiation profiles of proximate partons. We explore these observables in this section.

Jet mass is the most natural discriminator between jets originating from V decays and those originating from single partons. Jet grooming techniques improve mass resolution by reducing the effects from pileup and underlying event. The following grooming algorithms are studied:

\paragraph{N-subjetiness}\label{tau21sec}
This method uses the distribution of jet constituents relative to the jet axis in order to quantify how well the jet can be divided into N subjets. The computation is done by reclustering the jet using the kT-algorithm until N protojets are left. The direction of the remaining jets are then used to compute the "N-subjetiness" as
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_{N}=\dfrac{1}{d_{0}} \sum_{k}\: p_{T,k}\times \text{min}\left( \Delta R_{1,k}, \Delta R_{2,k},\dots,\Delta R_{N,k}\right) 
\end{eqnarray}
with the normalization factor $d_{0}$ :
\begin{eqnarray}
d_{0} = \sum_{k} p_{T,k}\times R_{0}
\end{eqnarray}
and $R_{0}$ is the clustering parameter of the original jet, $p_{ T,k}$ is the pT of the k-th jet constituent and $\Delta R_{n,k}$ is its distance to the n-th subjet. In particular, the ratio of the "2-subjettiness" to the "1-subjettiness" $(\tau_{2} / \tau_{1} = \tau_{21} )$ has excellent capability at separating jets originating from boosted vector bosons from jets originating from quarks and gluons.
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{$\tau_{21}$ distribution for signal and background \label{jettau21figure}}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{physics_objects_plots/tau21}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Pruning}\label{prun}
This method attempts to isolate subjet showers by removing soft, large angle particles from each subjet. Pruning will remove the uncorrelated contributions from underlaying events and pile up that make significant contributions to the jet mass. The mass of the resulting pruned jet is small if we start with a QCD jet, and near the particle mass if we start with a jet containing the decay products of a heavy particle. 
%Procedure: Define parameters $z_{\text{cut}}$=0.1 and $r_{\text{cut}}=0.5$. Reclustering with sequential recombination algorithm (CA), veto soft and large-angle recombination between pseudojets $i$ and $j$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta R_{ij}> r_{\text{cut}}\times\dfrac{2m}{p_{T}},\ \ \  \ \  z=\text{min}\left( \dfrac{p_{Ti}, p_{T_{j}}}{p_{T_{i+j}}} \right) < z_{\text{cut}}  
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Missing Transverse Energy ($\met$) }\label{MET1}

Missing transverse momentum plays a critical role in many physics analyses at the LHC. It is a key variable in many searches for physics beyond the standard model, such as extra dimensions and supersymmetry as well as for collider dark matter searches. Some neutral particles which interact weakly with matter ( \ie   neutrinos ) leave the detector without producing any direct response in the detector components. The presence of such particles (also called invisible particles, Fig. \ref{figuremet1}) must be implied from the imbalance of total momentum considering that the detector is hermetic. The vector momentum imbalance in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction is particularly useful in $\cPp\cPp$ and $\ppbar$ colliders, and is known as missing transverse momentum, here denoted $\vec{\met}$ . Its magnitude is called missing transverse energy, and is denoted $\met$ (MET).

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Invisible and visible particles \label{figuremet1}}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{physics_objects_plots/met_rec}
\end{figure}

In general $\vec{\met}$ is calculated as the negative of the vector sum of the components of momentum transverse to the beam axis of all final-state particles reconstructed in the detector. CMS has developed three distinct algorithms to reconstruct $\vec{\met}$. (a) Calo $\met$  based on calorimeter energies and calorimeter tower geometry, (b) TC $\met$ calculated by replacing the calorimeter tower energies matched to charged hadrons with their corresponding charged-track momenta, and (c)PF $\met$ calculated using a complete particle-flow technique. In thi work we will focus on PF $\met$.

The $\met$ reconstruction is sensitive to detector malfunctions and various reconstruction effects resulting in particle momentum mismeasurements and particle misidentification. Precise calibration of all physics objects is crucial for the $\met$ reconstruction, and $\met$ is particularly sensitive to multiple proton-proton interactions in the same, earlier, and later bunch crossings (pileup interactions). Thus, it is essential to study reconstruction in detail with data.

In Run-I, identifying and removing the causes of large fake $\met$ was the major challenge in $\met$ reconstruction at CMS. By the time Run-I ended in early 2013, it was developed a matured set of $\met$ filters to reject such large fake $\met$. These filters are used in the event selections of many physics analyses. Below is a list of the main filters:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
CSC tight beam halo filter
\item
HBHE noise filter with isolated noise rejection
\item
HCAL laser filter
\item
ECAL dead cell trigger primitive (TP) filter
\item
Tracking failure filter
\item
Bad EE Supercrystal filter
\item
ECAL Laser correction filter
\item
Tracking POG filters
\end{itemize}

Some filters are used online in HLT. After the $\met$ filters are applied, the agreement of the $\met$ spectrum
with simulation, significantly improves (Fig. \ref{figuremetmiss} )
\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Comparison before and after apply the $\met$ Filters. \label{figuremetmiss}}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{physics_objects_plots/met_missrec}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Particle Flow MET (PF $\met$)}

The particle flow technique aims to reconstruct a complete, unique list of particles in each event using an optimal combination of information across all CMS subdetector systems. Particles which are
reconstructed and identified include muons, electrons (with associated bremsstrahlung photons), photons (unconverted and converted), and charged and neutral hadrons. The PF $\met$ hereafter called MET is then simply the negative vector sum of all such reconstructed particles in the event (Fig. \ref{figuremet2}).
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\met} = - \sum_{i \in  \text{vis.}}\:\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}_{i}} 
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Vector sum of the reconstructed particles in the event. \label{figuremet2}}
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=14cm]{physics_objects_plots/met2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Type-I Correction}\label{typeI}

Raw MET is the negative of the vector sum of all reconstructed particles. The raw MET is systematically different from true MET, i.e., the transverse momentum carried by invisible particles, for many reasons including the non-compensating nature of the calorimeters and detector misalignment. To make MET a better estimate of true MET, MET corrections can be applied. The Type-I correction is the most popular MET correction in CMS. This correction is a propagation of the jet energy corrections (JEC) to MET. The Type-I correction replaces the vector sum of transverse momenta of particles which can be clustered as jets with the vector sum of the transverse momenta of the jets to which JEC is applied. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\met}^{\text{raw}} = - \sum_{i\in \text{all}}\:\vec{p}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{i}} 
\end{eqnarray}

The particles can be classified into two disjoint sets: either clustered as jets or unclustered
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\met}^{\text{raw}} = - \sum_{i\in \text{jets}}\:\vec{p}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{i}} - \sum_{i\in \text{uncl.}}\:\vec{p}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{i}}
\end{eqnarray}

The vector sum of $\ptrans$ of all particles clustered as jets is the same as the vector sum of $\ptrans$ of all jets.
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{i\in\text{jets}}\:\vec{p}^{\,\text{raw}}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{\text{jet}}} = \sum_{i\in \text{jets}}\:\vec{p}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{i}} 
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\met}^{\text{raw}} = - \sum_{\text{jet}}\:\vec{p}^{\,\text{raw}}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{\text{jet}}} - \sum_{i\in \text{uncl.}}\:\vec{p}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{i}}
\end{eqnarray}

The Type-I correction replaces the raw jet pT with the corrected jet pT
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{C}^{\text{Type-I}}_{T}= \sum_{\text{jet}}\:\vec{p}^{\,\text{raw}}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{\text{jet}}} - \sum_{\text{jet}}\:\vec{p}^{\,\text{JEC}}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{\text{jet}}}
\end{eqnarray}

The Type-I correction is a vector term that can be added to raw MET
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\met}^{\text{Type-I}} = \vec{\met}^{\text{raw}} + \vec{C}^{\text{Type-I}}_{T}
\end{eqnarray}
The Type-I corrected MET can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec{\met}^{\text{Type-I}} =  - \sum_{\text{jet}}\:\vec{p}^{\,\text{JEC}}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{\text{jet}}} - \sum_{i\in \text{uncl.}}\:\vec{p}_{\,\mathrm{T}_{i}
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Transverse Mass}\label{transvserve}

In this analysis we perform a search in the JET + MET final state as we will discuss in detail in the next chapter. The strategy is search for an excess related with the mass of the resonance. For that reason is neccesary introduce a variable associated with this magnitude. Since the invisible particles are not directly detected in the experiment, it is difficult to reconstruct the mass of the resonance. Consider a single heavy particle of mass $M$ which decays in a JET (labeled particle 1) and MET (labeled particle 2). The mass of the parent particle can be constrained with the quantity $M_{T}$ defined by:
\begin{eqnarray}
M_{T}^{2} &=& (E_{T}(1)+E_{T}(2))^{2}  - (\vec{p}_{T}(1)+\vec{p}_{T}(2))^{2}\nonumber\\
&=& E_{T}(1)^{2} + E_{T}(2)^{2} +2 E_{T}(1)E_{T}(2) -\vec{p}_{T}(1)^{2} - \vec{p}_{T}(2)^{2} -2\vec{p}_{T}(1)\cdot \vec{p}_{T}(2)\nonumber\\
\end{eqnarray}
Considering that:
\begin{eqnarray}
E_{T}^{2} = m^{2}+\vec{p}_{T}^{2},\ \   \text{and}\ \  m(1),m(2) \approx 0
\end{eqnarray}
We obtain:
\begin{eqnarray}
M_{T}^{2} = 2 \left| \vec{p}_{T}(1)\right| \left| \vec{p}_{T}(2)\right| \left(1-\cos\phi \right) 
\end{eqnarray}
Remember that: $p_{T}(1)=p_{T}^{\text{jet}},\ \   \text{and}\ \  \met=p_{T}(2)$.
Finally we get:
\begin{eqnarray}
M_{T} = \sqrt{\:2\: p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\: \met\: \left[ 1-\cos\Delta\phi\left( \text{jet}, \met\right)  \right] } 
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Muons}\label{muons}

The muon reconstruction is done prior to the particle-flow event reconstruction. The recon-
structed muons [12], referred to as “reco muons” in the following, contain a significant amount
of misidentified (un-decayed) charged hadrons. In order to have a pure sample of muon can-
didates, identification requirements must be applied to the original reco muon collection. A
standard choice of possible selections is presented in Ref. [12] and will be referred as soft,
global and tight muon selections, hereafter. The particle-flow algorithm makes use of some of
these identification tools and together with the use of the measurement of energy released in
the calorimeter, defines an alternative set of selections which are appropriate for and needed
by the particle-flow algorithm.


In the standard CMS reconstruction for pp collisions [2, 15], tracks are first reconstructed independently in the inner tracker (called \emph{tracker track)} and in the muon system ( called \emph{standalone-muon track}).
Based on these objects, two reconstruction approaches are used:

Global Muon reconstruction (outside-in). For each standalone-muon track, a matching
tracker track is found by comparing parameters of the two tracks propagated onto a
common surface. A global-muon track is fitted combining hits from the tracker track
and standalone-muon track, using the Kalman-filter technique. At large trans-
verse momenta, p T 200 GeV/c, the global-muon fit can improve the momentum
resolution compared to the tracker-only fit.

Tracker Muon reconstruction (inside-out). In this approach, all tracker tracks with p T >
0.5 GeV/c and total momentum p > 2.5 GeV/c are considered as possible muon can-
didates and are extrapolated to the muon system taking into account the magnetic
field, the average expected energy losses, and multiple Coulomb scattering in the
detector material. If at least one muon segment (i.e., a short track stub made of DT
or CSC hits) matches the extrapolated track, the corresponding tracker track qualifies as a Tracker Muon. Track-to-segment matching is performed in a local (chamber)
coordinate system, where local x is the best-measured coordinate (in the $r-\varphi$ plane)
and local y is the coordinate orthogonal to it. The extrapolated track and the seg-
ment are considered to be matched if the distance between them in local x is less
than 3 cm or if the value of the pull for local x is less than 4, where the pull is defined



\subsection{Muon isolation} 
The requirement that a muon is an isolated particle in the event, meaning that the energy flow
in its vicinity is below a certain threshold, can effectively discriminate muons from the decays
of W and Z bosons from those produced in heavy-flavor decays and hadron decays in flight.
The discriminating variable $I_{\text{rel}}$ (RelIso) is the sum of the $\pt$ of all charged hadrons, the transverse energies $\ET$ of all photons, and $\ET$ of all neutral hadrons reconstructed by the PF algorithm within a cone of radius $\Delta R <$ 0.4 centred on the muon track direction, divided by the muon track $\pt$:

\begin{eqnarray}
I_{\text{rel}} = \dfrac{\sum \pt(\text{charged}) + \max \left[\sum \ET (\text{neutral}) + \sum \ET (\text{photon})-\Delta \beta, 0 \right]  }{\pt}
\end{eqnarray}

here $\Delta \beta$ is a correction based on the $\sum \pt$ of the charged particles in the cone of interest but with particles not originating from the primary vertex (PU corrections).

defines the cone axis. The energy deposit in the cone is computed, and the muon contribution is removed by excluding the small area around the muon (the veto value) from the cone. Comparison of the deposit in the cone with a predefined threshold determines the muon isolation. \label{muoniso}}
